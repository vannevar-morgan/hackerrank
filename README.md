hackerrank
=============================================

Solutions to various hackerrank problems.  Honestly I think hackerrank is kinda a waste of time.  Solving hackerrank problems is more about solving hackerrank problems than it is about programming.  But the site gets used a lot for interviewing so it's useful to practice with, for that purpose only.
